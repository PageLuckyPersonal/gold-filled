    <h3>What is the Value of Gold Filled Jewelry?</h3>
    <p>Gold filled jewelry is significantly more valuable than gold plated jewelry. The biggest difference between godl fill and gold plate is the amount the gold present in the design and the length of time that gold will last. Gold fill hewelry will last
      a very long time, typically the purchaser's entire lifetime and then some. Now only does gold fill last longer, it's more convenient to wear. It's usually ok to wash your hands, or to shower while wearing gold filled jewelry. However gold plated
      jewelry pieces should be removed each time. Because gold filling requires more gold, it already costs more than plating. Add to that superior longevity and it's ability to mimic the look of solid gold, and you can easily understand why customers
      are willing to pay a bit more for it. With gold filled styles, you can typically expect to pay twice as much as plated styles to start. The final markup will vary by the size and intricacy of the design itself too. The next time someone asks you
      what is the difference between gold filled and gold plated jewelry, you can stress to them the difference of longevity and ease of wear.</p>

    <h3>Is Gold Filled or Gold Plated Better For You?</h3>
    <p>Now that you know what is the difference between gold plated and gold filled jewelry, you should be able to decide which style is best for you. If you like a current on trend jewelry style it's probably best to choose a gold plated ring, bracelet
      or necklace. Popular and trending styles don't typically stay popular for more than a few seasons. You probably won't wear them every day either. Since it's not going to be something you wear frequently or probably keep for more than a year, go
      ahead and look for plated styles and save your money. For shoppers looking for a personalized everyday accessory like a bar necklace or namebar ring, you should invest in a gold filled accessory. Many shoppers looking for alternative engagement
      rings also rely heavily on gold filled engagement rings. Sometimes that's just their earth-friendly choice, and for others it's a long last placeholder until they can afford what they really want.</p>
